# üìã Running the WordPress Automation - Detailed Guide

This guide explains both automation options from the "3Ô∏è‚É£ Run Automation" section in detail.

## Overview

The automation script will automatically:
- Create 6 pages (About, Start Here, Contact, Privacy Policy, Affiliate Disclosure, Medical Disclaimer)
- Create 2 blog posts with French Bulldog allergy content
- Set up 5 categories
- Configure 2 menus (Primary and Footer)
- Set your homepage and blog page
- Configure basic WordPress settings

## Option A: Direct File Upload (Easiest Method)

### Step 1: Prepare the Files
You should already have `frenchie-wordpress-upload.zip` from running `prepare-for-upload.sh`.

### Step 2: Access Your WordPress Files
You'll need access to your WordPress files via:
- FTP/SFTP client (like FileZilla)
- Web hosting control panel file manager
- Local development environment file system

### Step 3: Upload the Automation Files
1. Navigate to your WordPress `wp-content/` directory
2. Upload these from the `wordpress-upload-ready` folder:
   - `automation/setup-automation.php` file
   - `import-content/` folder (entire folder with its contents)

Your structure should look like:
```
wp-content/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup-automation.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ import-content/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ site-content/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ legal-pages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ themes/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Step 4: Run the Script
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: `http://your-domain.com/wp-content/setup-automation.php`
   - Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain
   - For local development: `http://frenchie-allergy-help.local/wp-content/setup-automation.php`

### Step 5: Watch the Output
The script will display:
```
üêæ Frenchie Allergy Help - Automated Setup
==========================================

Creating categories...
‚úÖ Category 'Allergies' created
‚úÖ Category 'Health' created
...

Creating pages...
‚úÖ Page 'About' created
‚úÖ Page 'Start Here' created
...

Setup completed successfully!
```

### Step 6: Delete the Setup File
**IMPORTANT:** After successful completion, delete `setup-automation.php` from wp-content/ for security.

## Option B: REST API Method (Remote Setup)

### Step 1: Prepare the Script
1. Open `/workspace/wordpress-automation/rest-api-setup.php`
2. Update the configuration section (lines 14-20):

```php
$config = [
    'site_url' => 'http://your-wordpress-site.com', // Your actual WordPress URL
    'username' => 'your_admin_username', // Your WordPress admin username
    'password' => 'your_admin_password', // Your WordPress admin password
    'content_path' => __DIR__ . '/../site-content/',
    'legal_path' => __DIR__ . '/../legal-pages/'
];
```

### Step 2: Enable Application Passwords (if needed)
1. Log into WordPress admin
2. Go to Users ‚Üí Your Profile
3. Scroll to "Application Passwords"
4. Create a new application password
5. Use this password in the config instead of your regular password

### Step 3: Run the Script
From your terminal:
```bash
cd /workspace/wordpress-automation
php rest-api-setup.php
```

### Step 4: Monitor Progress
You'll see output like:
```
üêæ WordPress REST API Setup
==========================

‚úÖ Authentication successful

Creating categories...
‚úÖ Created category: Allergies
‚úÖ Created category: Health
...
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "File not found" errors
- Ensure the `import-content` folder is in the same directory as `setup-automation.php`
- Check file permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)

### "Cannot connect to database" errors
- The script needs to load WordPress - ensure wp-load.php path is correct
- Try moving the script to different locations if needed

### REST API authentication fails
- Enable application passwords in WordPress
- Check if REST API is enabled on your host
- Verify username and password are correct

### Content not importing
- Check PHP memory limit (increase if needed)
- Try importing one section at a time
- Verify HTML files exist in import-content folders
