<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Sarah Mitchell, and I'm on a mission to help French Bulldog parents manage their pup's allergies naturally and effectively.</p>

<h2>My Story</h2>

<p>Three years ago, I brought home my French Bulldog, Bella. Within weeks, she developed severe skin allergies that left her miserable and me feeling helpless. Multiple vet visits, expensive medications, and sleepless nights became our new normal.</p>

<p>After spending over ‚Ç¨3,000 on treatments with minimal improvement, I decided there had to be a better way. I dove deep into research, consulted with veterinary dermatologists, and connected with hundreds of Frenchie parents facing similar struggles.</p>

<p>What I discovered changed everything: most French Bulldog allergies can be managed effectively with the right knowledge and approach. Bella is now thriving, and I've made it my mission to share what I've learned with fellow Frenchie parents.</p>

<h2>Why I Started This Site</h2>

<p>French Bulldogs are prone to allergies, with studies showing that up to 30% suffer from some form of allergic condition. Yet, finding reliable, practical information specifically for our breed was nearly impossible. This site fills that gap with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Breed-specific guidance:</strong> What works for other dogs often doesn't work for Frenchies</li>
<li><strong>Practical solutions:</strong> Real-world advice from someone who's been there</li>
<li><strong>Science-backed information:</strong> Every recommendation is researched and vet-reviewed</li>
<li><strong>Community support:</strong> You're not alone in this journey</li>
</ul>

<p>Bella is my 4-year-old fawn French Bulldog and the inspiration behind this site. After struggling with severe food and environmental allergies for her first year, she's now living her best life thanks to the protocols we've developed together.</p>

<p>Her favorite things: salmon treats (hypoallergenic!), afternoon naps, and showing other Frenchies that allergies don't have to limit their joy.</p>
