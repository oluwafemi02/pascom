<p>Seasonal allergies, also called atopic dermatitis or environmental allergies, occur when your Frenchie's immune system overreacts to airborne allergens. Their flat faces and compromised breathing make them particularly susceptible to inhaled allergens.</p>

<h2>Recognizing Seasonal Allergy Symptoms</h2>

<li><strong>Ear infections:</strong> Recurring during allergy season</li>
<li><strong>Skin changes:</strong> Redness, rashes, or hives</li>
</ul>

<h3>Secondary Complications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bacterial skin infections from scratching</li>
<li>Yeast overgrowth in ears and skin folds</li>
<li>Hair loss in affected areas</li>
<li>Behavioral changes due to discomfort</li>
<li>Sleep disruption (for both dog and owner!)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Emergency Relief: What to Do Right Now</h2>

<h2>Success Story: Bella's Journey</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"Bella's spring allergies were so bad she'd scratch until she bled. We started the prevention protocol in February - omega-3s, weekly baths, and daily wipe-downs. When spring hit, we added Zyrtec. She still has some itchy days, but nothing like before. The key was starting early and being consistent!" - Sarah, Site Owner</p>
